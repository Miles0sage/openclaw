        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>
          Overseer AI Agency provides an
          <strong>AI-powered code generation and delivery service</strong>. The Service enables
          clients to submit software engineering tasks which are executed by a pipeline of
          autonomous AI agents. Upon completion, deliverables are provided as GitHub pull requests
          containing generated source code, tests, and documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service includes: task submission via the client portal, autonomous multi-agent
          execution, automated quality verification, GitHub pull request delivery, real-time job
          status monitoring, and usage-based billing.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2>2. AI-Generated Code Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>All code delivered by the Service is generated by AI agents.</strong> You
          acknowledge and agree that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            AI-generated code may contain errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities not detected by
            automated quality gates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You are solely responsible</strong> for reviewing all delivered code before
            deploying it to any production environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Service makes no warranty of fitness for any particular purpose. Delivered code is a
            starting point, not a finished product.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quality gates reduce — but do not eliminate — the possibility of defects in delivered
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Human review by a qualified engineer is strongly recommended before production use.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Excluded damages:</strong> Overseer AI Agency shall not be liable for any
            indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of
            revenue, loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, even if advised of the
            possibility of such damages.
          </li>
          <li>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Overseer AI Agency from any claims arising from
            your use of delivered code in production environments.
